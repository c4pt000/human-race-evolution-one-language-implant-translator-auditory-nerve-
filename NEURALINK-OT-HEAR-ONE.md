# human-race-evolution-one-language-implant-translator-auditory-nerve

the human race would make advancements in its evoloution if the entire human race started to have mandatory ear impants (think neuralink) but only for the auditory nerve

as an electronic device that translates any incoming sound of langauge to the person's native language of choice to help the human race evolve faster with greater strides


because people speak their own native langauges its hard for the human race to intercommunicate on an easier level with itself to solve its own problems at a quicker group rate world wide

and to resolve conflicts or to have better emptatic values of other cultures of other languages of other origins

to have the human race as one construct of communication worldwide
